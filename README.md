## ⚙️ How it works

The converter uses FFmpeg with:

```bash
-c copy
```

This means:

* ✅ No quality loss
* ⚡ Very fast
* ❗ Works only if codecs are compatible with MP4

---

## 🔧 Optional: Re-encoding

If you run into compatibility issues, replace:

```bash
-c copy
```

with:

```bash
-c:v libx264 -c:a aac
```
